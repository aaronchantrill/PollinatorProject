# PollinatorProject
Two programs I used for a project I did for my C683 Natural Science Labs class at Western Governors University.

Pollinators.py was the program that used to capture videos of the pollinators. This was launched by a cron job at 10AM, 1PM, and 4PM

Player.py was the program I used to do the actual counting, drawing a box on the screen for counting "hits" and allowing rewind and hits counting.
